I am going to show you how you can have rich test environment in no time
and without any efforts.

We will use Selenuim WebDriver in Selenium Grid run locally in docker-compose configuration.

And write tests in Python.

As test reporter we will use Allure.

And all of this can be spin up just in one command.

You need:
* Working docker-compose
* Python 3 (all pip package we will install)

Download [template](https://github.com/andgineer/e2e-tests)

    git pull https://github.com/andgineer/e2e-tests.git
    
Go to folder `e2e-tests` and run:    

    docker-compose up -d
    
Now we have reporting service on `http://localhost:4040`. 
It automatically builds reports for data inside folder `allure-results`.

Also now we have Selenium Grid up and running.
It serves `Chrome`, `Edge` and `Firefox` browsers so we can use them 
in tests. 

We use docker to run Selenium Grid effortlessly.

That's all! Run tests with

    . ./activate.sh
    ./scripts/test.sh
    
And see report `http://localhost:4040`.
