I'll show you how to set up a comprehensive testing environment quickly 
and effortlessly.

We'll be using Selenium WebDriver within a Selenium Grid, run locally 
via a Docker Compose configuration, and writing our tests in Python. 

For reporting, we'll use Allure. 

And the best part? You can set everything up with just one command.

**You'll need:**
- A functioning [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) setup
- Python 3 (we'll install all necessary pip packages)

First, download the template:

```
git pull https://github.com/andgineer/e2e-tests.git
```

Navigate to the `e2e-tests` folder and run:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

Now, a Selenium Grid is operational, supporting `Chrome`, `MS Edge` 
and `Firefox` browsers for testing, console is available at `http://localhost:4040`. 

It automatically generates reports from the data inside the 
`allure-results` folder.

Resulting Allure report is published at `http://localhost:4040`.

To run tests from `tests/` and view the report, execute:

```
. ./activate.sh
./scripts/test.sh
```

Our tests include a `--host` parameter to specify the URL of the web application being tested. 
Implementation details see in 
[pytest hook pytest_addoption](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/how-to/writing_hook_functions.html#using-hooks-in-pytest-addoption) 
of `conftest.py`. 

For instance, to test `https://google.com`, you would run:

```
scripts/test.sh --host=https://google.com
```

This test will fail, as the word "Python" is not present on the Google main page.

For tips on capturing screenshots when tests fail and adding 
them to the report, check out my
