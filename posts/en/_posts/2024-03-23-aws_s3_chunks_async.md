When working with large files in an asynchronous environment, such as AWS S3 with Python, efficiency and memory management 
become crucial. 

The [aiobotocore](https://aiobotocore.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library offers a way to read large files in chunks, 
which is essential for not overloading your application's memory. 

However, when you need to handle these files with operations that expect a file-like object—like `pickle.load()` or 
`json.load()`—things get a bit trickier.

## Reading Files in Chunks with aiobotocore

To read a complete file from S3 using aiobotocore, you typically set up a loop to read the file in parts. 

Here's what that looks like:

```python
resp = yield from s3.get_object(Bucket='mybucket', Key='k')
stream = resp['Body']
try:
    while True:
      chunk = yield from stream.read(1024)
      ...
      if len(chunk) > 0:
          break
finally:
  stream.close()
```

This method is effective for managing memory usage, as it prevents your application from loading the entire file into 
memory all at once. 

But what if your application needs a file-like object?

## The Challenge with File-like Operations

Certain operations in Python, such as `pickle.load()` or `json.load()`, expect a file-like object and will attempt 
to read the entire file at once. 

This approach can be inefficient, especially when dealing with large files or when only a part of the file is needed, 
as it loads the full file into memory.

For example, `pickle` reads objects piece by piece; you don't need to load the full file into memory to work with it. 

However, the standard chunk-reading approach doesn't provide a file-like object that these operations require.

## aioS3 to the Rescue

Enter [aioS3](https://github.com/andgineer/aios3/actions). This tool extends the functionality of aiobotocore by offering a 
`stream()` method that provides a file-like interface with a customizable chunk size. 

This means you can efficiently read large files from S3 in chunks, just like before, but now in a way that's 
compatible with operations that need a file-like object.

With aioS3, you can enjoy the best of both worlds: efficient memory management and the ability to use file-like 
operations on your S3-hosted files without loading the entire file into memory. 

It's an essential tool for any asynchronous Python application working with large files in AWS S3.
