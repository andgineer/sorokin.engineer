🚨 bookmate.com - angry consumer review 🚨

![](/images/bookmate.png){:.post-title}

📚 Imagine diving into a book, only to hit a brick wall one-third of the way through. 

No ending, just an abrupt stop. That was my intro to Bookmate's world. 
When I reached out for help, all I got was a 'We'll check with the publisher' and then... silence.

🔍 Next challenge: navigating the maze. 

Trying to find the book I was reading felt like being lost in a library with no map. 
And searching for a new read? A wild goose chase thanks to the author name spelling lottery. 
Found a book you like? 
Good luck finding others by the same author - you'll need to decode the spelling variations first.

💔 The deal-breaker? 

I canceled auto-renewal, not the subscription, hoping to avoid future disappointment. 
Yet, my account's now a ghost town of 'buy subscription' banners, with access only to teasers. 
My year-long subscription vanished into thin air after just two months.

💸 In short: 

I paid for a year, got two months of frustration, and was left with nothing but regrets. 
A cautionary tale for anyone considering Bookmate.
